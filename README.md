Design an ERD for an E-commerce app (the implementation will come later as we progress in the program)

You should have at least 3 entities: Product, User, and Order

Do keep in mind that:
- This is a teamwork
- The entities we are suggesting are just basic ones; feel free to add more.

Assignment delivery:
- Team lead to fork this repo and then the team memembers should fork the team lead's repo.
- Or feel free to follow a specific approach that you as a team would agree on.
- Team lead to open a PR against Integrify's repo
- Share an image of your ERD Or share a link to an online playground

Investigate online potential entities and properties for your system. Make sure you don't overwhelm yourself with a lot of entities.

You could have two versions: a basic approach and another intermediate approach in case you will have enough time while implementing.
PS: You should be able to refactor from a basic approach to intermediate with the least hassle.
